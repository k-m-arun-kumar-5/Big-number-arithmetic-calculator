Description
===========
Big number basic arithmetic calculator of additions, subractions, division, multiplications and modulations, using dynamic memory allocation. Arbitrary-precision arithmetic, also called a big number arithmetic, multiple precision arithmetic, or sometimes infinite-precision arithmetic 
indicates that calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are limited only by the available memory of the host system. This contrasts with the faster fixed-precision arithmetic found in a most arithmetic logic unit (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8 and 64 bits 
of precision. A fixed point floating-point number is also supported. Big Number is in the form of string. Arithmetic operations supported are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplications, Division and Modulus.
