Description
===========
Big number basic arithmetic calculator of additions, subractions, division, multiplications and modulations, using dynamic memory allocation. Arbitrary-precision arithmetic, also called a big number arithmetic, multiple precision arithmetic, or sometimes infinite-precision arithmetic 
indicates that calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are limited only by the available memory of the host system. This contrasts with the faster fixed-precision arithmetic found in a most arithmetic logic unit (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8 and 64 bits 
of precision. A fixed point floating-point number is also supported. Big Number is in the form of string. Arithmetic operations supported are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplications, Division and Modulus.

Purpose :
=========
In all my respective repositories, I,  K.M. Arun Kumar alias Arunkumar Murugeswaran, just shared my works that I worked as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files and some programming that might not being implement, not being completed, lacks some features or have some bugs. Purpose of all my repositories, if used, can be used for LEARNING AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY. It can be used as the open source and freeware. Kindly read the LICENSE.txt for license, terms and conditions about the use of source codes, binaries, documentation and all other files, located in all my repositories. 

My Thanks and Tribute :
========================
I thank to my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, all those who directly or indirectly supported me and/or helped me and/or my family, Nature and God. My tribute to my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, Nature, Jimmy Dog, God and all those, who directly or indirectly help and/or support me and/or my family.

Toolchains that I used for C Application design and development are as follows :

2: Desktop Computer Architecture and OS for C Programming                   - Intel X64 & Windows 8.1 (64 bit).
3: Code editor                                                              - Notepad++.
4: Documentation                                                            - Microsoft Office 2007 (alternative LibreOffice) and Text Editor. 
5: File Archiver                                                            - 7-Zip.                 

Some reference that I refered for C Application design and development, are as follows :
